	- One that shoots firey energy blasts (similar to the Drone) instead of bullets. This has a 30% chance to appear in place of a regular cultist.
		+ Additionally, you can place this in maps. Palette 15 on a cultist will make it into this version.
	- One that fires unless the line of sight is broken. Palette 78 will make a cultist into this type. This has a 10% chance to appear in place of a regular cultist. Also has a little more health.
	- If you don't want these to randomly appear, comment out the "include scripts/am_mutator_e.con" line in "am.con". That's the enemy mutator file.
* There is a new Diopede type that spits acid in more areas at once and has more overall health. It has palette 137 and is a bit bigger than the regular diopede.
* You can now place enemies with different palette colors in your maps. The default colors will be instantiated if palette is left as is, which is 0.
* Added a new enemy: Seeker Drone (Tile 11744). Acts a bit like the drones but they are weaker, and can sometimes move to dodge while firing. They do area damage when dead.
